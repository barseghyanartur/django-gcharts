Yet another Google Charts library for Django

_Requires installation of the gviz_api library which is freely available from Google.
See https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/dev/gviz_api_lib for details._

## Note
**This library is yet in pre-alpha development mode, and only uploaded to github for the purpose of having it
for my own sake. It's still not ready for use, do _NOT_ use this for anything except experimenting.**

Please feel free to fork or submit patches ;)
