Yet another Google Charts library for Django

- Requires installation of the gviz_api library which is freely available from Google.
- See http://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-python/ for details.

## Note
This library is yet in pre-alpha development mode, and only uploaded to github for the purpose of having it
for my own sake. It's still not ready for use, do _NOT_ use this for anything except experimenting.

Please feel free to fork or submit patches ;)
