Yet another Google Charts library for Django

- Requires installation of the gviz_api library which is freely available from Google.
- See http://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-python/ for details.

## Note ##
This library is yet in pre-alpha development mode, and only uploaded to github for the purpose of having it
for my own sake. It's still not ready for use, do _NOT_ use this for anything except experimenting.

Please feel free to fork or submit patches ;)

### Disclaimer ###
This library is heavy influenced by [mvasilkov's django-google-charts](https://github.com/mvasilkov/django-google-charts),
and some of the code (template tags and javascript code) are directly copied from him. I've done some minor adjustments to
make it work for my approach.

### About django-gcharts ###
As I find mvasilkov's approach very clever, I think it would've been nice if the model could deliver it's data in a format
the Google Charts API can read.

This library is an attempt of doing that, by using a custom QuerySet and Manager which is plugged directly into the model,
and some wrapper methods to bind the QuerySet data up against the gviz_api library.
The goal is to "fully" support the QuerySet (with aggregates, joins, extra, annotates, etc) so that we can gather data
by using familiar QuerySet syntax.

#### models.py ####

Register the GChartsManager to the model you'd like to draw charts from

        from django.db import models
        from gcharts import GChartsManager
        
        class MyModel(models.Model):
                
                # register the GChartsManager as a manager for this model
                gcharts = GChartsManager()
                # when using multiple managers, we need to specify the default 'objects' manager as well
                objects = models.Manager()
                
                my_field = models.CharField(....)
                my_other_field = models.IntegerField()
                
                ...
